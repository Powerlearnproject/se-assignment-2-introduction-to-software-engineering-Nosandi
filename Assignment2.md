- **Enhances Scalability:**
  - **Independent Development:** Different teams can work on different modules simultaneously, accelerating development.
  - **Reuse:** Modules can be reused across different projects, saving time and effort.
  - **Flexibility:** New features can be added as new modules without altering existing ones.

**Testing in Software Engineering:**

**Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?**

1. **Unit Testing:** Tests individual units or components of the software for correctness. It ensures each part functions as expected in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing:** Tests the interaction between integrated units to identify interface defects and interaction issues.
3. **System Testing:** Evaluates the complete integrated system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
4. **Acceptance Testing:** Validates the software against user requirements and ensures it is ready for deployment. Usually performed by end-users or clients.
